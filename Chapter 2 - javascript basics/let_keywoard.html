		<article>JavaScript now has lexical variable scope. In JavaScript, we create code blocks with
				curly braces ( {} ). In functions, these curly braces block off the scope of any variable
				declared with var . On the other hand, consider if/else statements. If youâ€™re coming
				from other languages, you might assume that these blocks would also block variable
				scope. This was not the case until let came along.
				If a variable is created inside of an if/else block, that variable is not scoped to the
				block

		Code:
	       <pre><code>

		       var topic = "Global";

			 if (topic) {
			     var topic = "Block";

			     console.log("block scope: topic = "+topic);

			     }

			 console.log("global scope: topic = "+topic);

	       </code></pre>

	       Output:

	       <pre><code>
		       block scope: topic = Block
		       block scope: topic = Block
	       </pre></code>
	       <br>
	       Code:
	       <pre><code>

		 let let_topic = "Global";

		  if (let_topic) {
		     let let_topic = "Block";

		      console.log("block scope: let_topic = "+let_topic);

		  }

		  console.log("global scope: let_topic = "+let_topic);

	       </code></pre>

	       Output:

	       <pre><code>
		       block scope: let_topic = Block
		       block scope: let_topic = Global
	       </pre></code>

	       <script>
		var topic = "Global";

		if (topic) {
		    var topic = "Block";

		    console.log("block scope: topic = "+topic);

		}

		console.log("global scope: topic = "+topic);
	       </script>
		 <script>
		 let let_topic = "Global";

		      console.log("block scope: let_topic = "+let_topic);

		  }

		  console.log("global scope: let_topic = "+let_topic);
