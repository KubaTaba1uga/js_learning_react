		<article>JavaScript now has lexical variable scope. In JavaScript, we create code blocks with
curly braces ( {} ). In functions, these curly braces block off the scope of any variable
declared with var . On the other hand, consider if/else statements. If you’re coming
from other languages, you might assume that these blocks would also block variable
scope. This was not the case until let came along.
If a variable is created inside of an if/else block, that variable is not scoped to the
block</article>
Code:
<pre><code>

	var topic = "Global";
	  
	  if (topic) {
	      var topic = "Block";

	      console.log("block scope: topic = "+topic);

	      }

	  console.log("global scope: topic = "+topic);
	  
</code></pre>
<h1> Output: </h1>
<pre><code>
	block scope: topic = Block
	block scope: topic = Block
</pre></code>
	<script>
	  var topic = "Global";
	  
	  if (topic) {
	      var topic = "Block";

	      console.log("block scope: topic = "+topic);

	      }

	  console.log("global scope: topic = "+topic);
	  </script>
	</body>
