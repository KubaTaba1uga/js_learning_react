	    Object literal enhancement is the opposite of destructuring. It’s the process of restruc‐
	    turing or putting the object back together. With object literal enhancement, we can
	    grab variables from the global scope and add them to an object.

	Code:
	<pre><Code>
	 let city_name = "Warsaw";
	 let districts = ["wola", "ochota", "praga"];
	 
	 let city = {city_name, districts};

	 console.log(city);
	</Code></pre>

	Output:
	<pre><Code>
	Object { city_name: "Warsaw", districts: (3) […] }
	</Code></pre>

	    We can also create object methods with object literal enhancement.

	Code:
	<pre><Code>

	let city_name = "Warsaw";
	let districts = ["wola", "ochota", "praga"];
	let print = function(){
	   console.log(`${this.city_name} districts are:\n${this.districts.join("\n")}`);
	}

	let city = {city_name, districts, print};

	city.print()
	</Code></pre>

	Output:
	<pre><Code>
	Warsaw districts are:
	wola
	ochota
	praga
	</Code></pre>
	    <script>
	     let city_name = "Warsaw";
	     let districts = ["wola", "ochota", "praga"];
	     let print = function(){
		 console.log(`${this.city_name} districts are:\n${this.districts.join("\n")}`);
	     }

	     let city = {city_name, districts, print};

	     city.print()
